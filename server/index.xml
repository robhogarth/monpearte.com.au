      <title>Why Password Security is Important</title>

      <description>I had a friend that got a job at the DOT in our state. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t a technical person just new the basics. He told me some stories about people looking at 20+ pages of citations and would print them off. They would then print the document and open the other screen where they had to look up the data and input new data. It would take them several minutes for each and they would only get through a handful of these a day per each person.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a veteran IT professional, I love to argue as much as the next veteran IT professional.  Mostly my arguments are harmless debates about the pros and cons of different brands of software, different architectural designs and who is the best companion in Doctor Who.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a number of trends out there that you should be considering and keeping your eye on, but don&amp;rsquo;t warrant an entire article this week.   Let&amp;rsquo;s look at micro trends of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 5 Trends of 2019 - Information Security is a Business Problem</title>
      <link>https://monpearte.com.au/post/top-5-trends-of-2019-information-security/</link>

      <guid>https://monpearte.com.au/post/top-5-trends-of-2019-information-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year I had the privilege of working with a company around their information security.  They successfully achieved their ISO 27001 certification.  For a relatively small business that was an enormous effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key reasons they were able to get certified is they realised that Information Security was a problem the entire business needed to attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 5 Trends of 2019 - Taking your Cloud Strategy Further</title>
      <link>https://monpearte.com.au/post/top-5-trends-of-2019-cloud-strategy/</link>

It&amp;rsquo;s 2019 do you know where your cloud strategy is at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you do, because a of people have it sorted already.  If not don&amp;rsquo;t despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you need a 100 page white paper detailing the experience, do you know what your overall strategy is?  Do you have a plan for expanding it this year?

      <title>Top 5 Trends of 2019 - Infrastructure as Code</title>
      <link>https://monpearte.com.au/post/top-5-trends-of-2019-infrastructure-as-code/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw a post on the sysadmin section of reddit, a tech who was celebrating the decommissioning of the primary mail server at his company.  He was saying goodbye to a server by name and thanking it for its service.  It was a reasonable size project, coordinating a lot of tasks, outages etc.  It paved the way for upgrades to future Exchange versions for him.  He was suitably excited and so he should have been.  A project done well is always a great feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, through all the congratulations, there were a few voices who reminded us all of the mantra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Servers are cattle, not pets, and definitely not snowflakes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Top 5 Trends of 2019 - Say Goodbye to Passwords</title>
      <link>https://monpearte.com.au/post/top-5-trends-of-2019-no-more-passwords/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://monpearte.com.au/post/top-5-trends-of-2019-no-more-passwords/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2019 is the year that we move on from passwords.&lt;img src=&#34;https://monpearte.com.au/images/bender-goodbye.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Goodbye Losers....I mean passwords!&#34; alt=&#34;Goodbye Losers....I mean passwords!&#34; align=right hspace=20&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone hates passwords.  IT people spend hours trying to enforce great habits, but somehow passwords always end up on sticky notes posted on a monitor.  Occasionally the sticky note is put in a drawer.  Nobody ever looks there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the good intentions of everyone involved, passwords are just not working.  The great news is, things are changing and passwords are going to be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Password Security is Important</title>

      <guid>https://monpearte.com.au/post/why-password-security-is-important/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While passwords can seem restrictive and difficult, ensuring you have secure passwords is important.  You may not think you have any information you want to protect, but look closer look.  Do you share passwords between systems? Is your banking login the same as Facebook and your email?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this sound like you?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When to host your own server</title>
      <link>https://monpearte.com.au/post/when-to-host-your-own-server/</link>

      <guid>https://monpearte.com.au/post/when-to-host-your-own-server/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After espousing the benefits of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://monpearte.com.au/post/do-i-need-a-server-room&#34;&gt;cloud here&lt;/a&gt;, there are some reasons why you&amp;rsquo;d want to host some of your infrastructure on your own premises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more technologists are shouting &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cloud Only&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; like it&amp;rsquo;s the only option you have.  However, the world is never that black and white, and your IT needs to work on this scale of grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A much better philosophy is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cloud preferably&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do I Need A Server Room</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s not your core business, then go to the cloud&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 do you &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; need a server room?  It depends on a lot of factors, but generally if you are a small business with without a specific onsite requirement for TI services then the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the concepts of bandwidth and latency is important in understanding how networkk and internet connections function and why slow can be ambiguous&lt;/p&gt;</description>
