						<p>Change is hard.  People love the status quo.  Wherever I look, there is always someone encouraging people to embrace change.  And today that’s going to be me.  I’m going to be your encouragement.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img src="/images/steppingontacks.jpg" class="rounded float-right" alt="Ouch!" title="Ouch!"></p>

<p>Look in IT change can be difficult.  It can be painful.  It can be costly.</p>

<p>What people fail to realise is that IT environments are ALWAYS changing.  Every second of every day nothing is staying the same.  If it did stay the same, we wouldn’t need to do daily backups.</p>

<p>The more we understand this the more you can embrace change in IT systems and help to make change smoother and even welcomed.</p>

<p>IT environments are in a constant state of small changes.  Every time someone does something, logs into a PC, or sends an email, logs are created, files are written to, TCP connections are made.  And with this, small things are changed.  A log file gets bigger, a database file adds a row and memory is allocated and deallocated.  These don’t sound like much, but they are all change, and it contributes to an environment that is slowly evolving over time.
Therefore, when we plan that large IT change, a new firewall, a some new software, or a new server, we need to be aware of this slowly evolving infrastructure.  Most of the time these incremental changes are easy to account for.  What catches us out is not this evolution, it’s the relative speed of different systems over time.  Not everything is evolving at the same rate.</p>

<p><img src="/images/evolution.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Everything is always evolving" title="Everything is always evolving"></p>

<p>And there-in lies the catch.</p>

<p>All the planning in the world and yet IT projects consistently fail in some way or another.  Usually there’s a catch, a small gotcha that no one ever thought to evaluate in the planning stage.  Why is that?  Why do I, as someone with over 20 years in this industry seem to be in this same scenario sometimes?</p>

<p>Well, I think it’s the differing rate of evolution gets us.  Some servers are changing and evolving at a known rate.  Server A is a known quantity, it gets enterprise policies and adheres to the intended network design and flow.  Server B we think is the same.  But when we start making large changes, we find out it’s not.  Sever B is not compliant, for whatever reason, and it’s mostly due to legacy issues.  And when we remove some item, which we thought was unused, or made a change we thought would be applied consistently to everything, we find it doesn’t work like that and things start to break.</p>

<p>We’ve been caught out!</p>

<p>Hopefully we allow extra time in our budget to resolve this “unknown unknown”.  But after the fact it’s always disappointing to see things never be quite so smooth.
And for a lot of people and businesses this leaves them feeling pretty defeated.   A change was tabled, researched, planned and implemented.  But it doesn’t go as smooth as designed and the takeaway lesson is:
<br></p>

<p><blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
  <p class="mb-0"><em>&ldquo;Never change anything.  It just makes things worse!&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<br></p>

<p>However, I’d argue that over the long-term life of an IT environment the more you can introduce some change and find these uncompliant systems the better.<br />
<br></p>

<p><blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
  <p class="mb-0"><em>&ldquo;A little chaos now and then is healthy”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<br></p>

<p><img src="/images/chaos.jpg" class="rounded float-right" alt="a little Jeff Goldblum makes everything better" title="a little Jeff Goldblum makes everything better"></p>

<p>While it can cause some issues within an IT system, things are temporarily broken, users are annoyed, etc.  What you find in this moment is a non-compliance, a snowflake, a ticking time bomb in your system.
And finding it now and fixing it, is better a thousand times better than leaving it unknown, unresolved and unevolved.</p>

<p>IT systems are always changing, evolving.  But they don’t always evolve at the same rate.  Whatever is stuck as a legacy system, is always at risk of being a known unknown or worse an unknown unknown.  Forcing the issue and evolving these systems, understanding them, rebuilding them can take some pain.</p>

<p>But ultimately through the change, unknowns and pain, your IT systems will be stronger than ever.  You’ll understand more of it.  You’ll know that it’s compliant.  You ensure that systems are consistent and more resilient.  You will have evolved your system to be stronger, faster and brighter than ever before.  You will find you reduce your break fix issues and those problems you just can’t understand.</p>

<p>After this temporary pain you might just find the most important thing that’s evolved is you&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
