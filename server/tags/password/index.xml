      <description>&lt;p&gt;2019 is the year that we move on from passwords.&lt;img src=&#34;https://monpearte.com.au/images/bender-goodbye.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Goodbye Losers....I mean passwords!&#34; alt=&#34;Goodbye Losers....I mean passwords!&#34; align=right hspace=20&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone hates passwords.  IT people spend hours trying to enforce great habits, but somehow passwords always end up on sticky notes posted on a monitor.  Occasionally the sticky note is put in a drawer.  Nobody ever looks there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the good intentions of everyone involved, passwords are just not working.  The great news is, things are changing and passwords are going to be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While passwords can seem restrictive and difficult, ensuring you have secure passwords is important.  You may not think you have any information you want to protect, but look closer look.  Do you share passwords between systems? Is your banking login the same as Facebook and your email?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this sound like you?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
