I had a friend that got a job at the DOT in our state. He wasn't a technical person just new the basics. He told me some stories about people looking at 20+ pages of citations and would print them off. They would then print the document and open the other screen where they had to look up the data and input new data. It would take them several minutes for each and they would only get through a handful of these a day per each person.

He noticed this and showed a person how to highlight the citation number, ctrl-c to copy, go to other screen ctrl-f to find and ctrl-v paste in the value. It took a process from several minutes down to seconds. This employees productivity went up 900%. Word started getting around about my friend the computer genius and he was soon teaching everyone.

Within a couple months he was promoted to supervisor of the department and has been promoted several times since then.




I remember the training people at my office got when the old Tandberg terminals disappeared and they got PCs instead... Just the bare necessities.

And we never made it mandatory. A lot of users were 'too busy' to waste a day on training.

The same users were also too busy when we switched to WinNT4.0, then to WinXP.

But when we went to Win7, we made it mandatory. No one got their PCs updated until they had been through training. And it was hands-on. And we made certain that some of the more recalcitrant users still had OLD PCs. 'Sorry, you're slated to get a new PC when we upgrade'.

(Had a 6month 'no replacement' period, Only if the PC physically broke did we swap it, and then usually for a just as old PC.)

The Heldesk reported a significant drop in 'general usage' requests afterwards...

Can't call in users for whole-day courses?

Consider running a series of nano-learning rounds.
