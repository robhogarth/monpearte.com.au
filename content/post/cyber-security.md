Many times IT professionals are viewed as the naysayers of doom when it comes to there outlook.  Through our training and definitely through past experience we are trained to anticipate and expect the worst.

We've been there staring into the void of broken IT systems and businesses ground to a halt and we never forget it.

That's how you can tell a Senior IT guy from a Junior.  The junior is all sunshine and lollipops, the senior guy, well he's seen some s**t and it scared the hell out of him.

With great power comes great responsibility.  Once we've been handed the keys to the IT kingdom we know that what we become responsible for in a large part is keeping the company going.

You may think that this is overstating things.  But consider what happens when IT systems stop working.  People can't work, orders can't be received or fulfilled, money can't flow in and out.  These things can be pretty devastating.  Imagine your business burned to the ground.  Everyone is ok (it was a Saturday), but what now?  Even if you had an offline copy of everyone's mobile to give them a buzz, and find a new office, how do you work?  

If you had thought things through, you'd have some backups, maybe redundancy, you bust out a credit card and buy some laptops from your local IT store.  A few days or weeks of partial business interruption but you get through.

Throw in some business insurance to help cover costs and you keep moving.  Hopefully your customers, partners and creditors are sympathetic.  For a lot of businesses that's a best case scenario.  A little extreme but there's plenty of disaster scenarios that some forward thinking can help overcome (tape backups are handy).

So go back to our senior and junior IT guys.  The real experienced guys, the ones who really know a crisis, burning buildings aren't what keep them awake at night.  They've got offsite backups, DR sites, redundant systems and business continuity plans.  The great ones even test these systems regularly (you do test right?).  

What really keeps these guys up is cyber security.

Consider that all that confidential data in your company.  Invoices, orders, employee details, customer records, partner records, market sensitive information, personally identifiable information, medical records.  That's a lot of information!  Sure as a company you have firewalls, passwords, and policies to keep things in place.

But consider the damage to your business if even a small amount of critical data was leaked and that was made public?

What does that do to your businesses' reputation?  Do customers, vendors, partners trust you to keep their information secure?  Would they still trust you after a breach?

Are you spending so much time and money building the reputation of the company but nothing on protecting it?

For a lot of businesses a data breach would be an instant game over.  Once the trust is gone there's no getting it back.

And that's what IT guys really worry about.  Servers can be rebuilt, devices can be connected, websites can be designed to never ever go down.  But loose the trust of your customers and partners with a data breach and there's nothing your IT team can do to fix that.

At least not after the fact.
