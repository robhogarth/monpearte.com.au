We can tailor a managed services solution for you.  Need 24x7 support? No worries.  Want our team onsite to be there when you need? Easy as.  We will monitor your equipment round the clock to ensure we can know and fix a problem before you ever know it happened.  We make sure your systems are patched and up to date and your data is always backed up.<p>
However, we go beyond just ensuring your tech is working and up to date.  Our team works with our managed services clients to analyse your business process and workflow, and help to continually improve the way you use your technology to make you more efficient.  We help develop long-term strategic plans and budgets.  We can help create IT governance plans, security risk analysis, and hardware and software lifecycle plans.<p>
All this for a fixed monthly price, we don't base prices on asset counts.  We support your business not your technology.<p>
