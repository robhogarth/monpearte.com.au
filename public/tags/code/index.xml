      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw a post on the sysadmin section of reddit, a tech who was celebrating the decommissioning of the primary mail server at his company.  He was saying goodbye to a server by name and thanking it for its service.  It was a reasonable size project, coordinating a lot of tasks, outages etc.  It paved the way for upgrades to future Exchange versions for him.  He was suitably excited and so he should have been.  A project done well is always a great feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, through all the congratulations, there were a few voices who reminded us all of the mantra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Servers are cattle, not pets, and definitely not snowflakes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
